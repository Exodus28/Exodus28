I'm Chris an aspiring web, games and blockchain dev. I'm setting this up to track my progress through learning different programming languages, and I've a number of personal projects I want to develop too. I first intend to become proficient in fundamentals of HTML5, CSS3, vanilla Javascript including more advanced concepts/features, and React/Angular. My next step would be to revisit C# and .NET with a focus on both games dev and back-end web dev, whilst also practicing/exploring other web-oriented languages/frameworks. Lastly I'd like to look into Blockchain/Solidity development.

Present day I'm making good progress making my way through several tutorials regarding HTML, CSS & Javascript - and will soon be looking to practice what I've learned with sample projects/portfolio pieces of my own, before looking at React/Angular.
